** In order for this to work, create database MVCDemo (or whatever you want to call it) using SSMS
** OR change the connection string to create a local database
** Run script Schema1_Initial.sql from BGoodMusic.EFDAL\BGM_SqlScripts
** OR let EF create the table automagically
** Then use Visual Studio or SSMS to manually add some entries to the Rehearsals table
** Change the name of the database in the connection string in web.config to match your database name
